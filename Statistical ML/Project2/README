In strategy 1 
you are required to implement the K-means algorithm and
apply your implementation on the given dataset (AllSamples.
npy), which contains a set of 2-D points. You are required
to implement the following strategy for choosing the initial
cluster centers.

In strategy 2
you are required to implement the K-means algorithm and
apply your implementation on the given dataset (AllSamples.
npy), which contains a set of 2-D points. You are required
to implement the following strategy for choosing the initial
cluster centers.
The Strategy2 is pick the first center randomly; for the ii-th
center (iiÂ¿1), choose a sample (among all possible samples)
such that the average distance of this chosen one to all previous
(ii-1) centers is maximal.
